# Personal Website
## Introduction 
* This website was not intended to be SPA website, but a multi-page website, I decided to omit the scrollbar as it would not fit with the design that I had in mind. 
* Moreover, my site navigation's bar is at the bottom and I replaced the text with Font Awesome icons to better the user experience.  
## Technologies
* JavaScript ES6
* HTML5
* CSS3
## Disclaimer
* I did not include the images nor the icons that I used in my site. Only the code is available in this repository.
