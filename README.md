# Personal Website
## Introduction 
* This website was not intended to be SPA website, but a multi-page website, I decided to omit the scrollbar as it would not fit with the design that I had in mind. 
* Additionally, I made the site navigation bar be at the bottom and replaced the text with Font Awesome icons that would be understood by a user as to what each of the tab meant to do. 
## Technologies
* JavaScript ES6
* HTML5
* CSS3
